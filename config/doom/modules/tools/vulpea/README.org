** Code completion
By default, completion is triggered after a short idle period or with the
[[kbd:][C-SPC]] key. While the popup is visible, the following keys are available:

| Keybind | Description                              |
|---------+------------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][C-n]]     | Go to next candidate                     |
| [[kbd:][C-p]]     | Go to previous candidate                 |
| [[kbd:][C-j]]     | (evil) Go to next candidate              |
| [[kbd:][C-k]]     | (evil) Go to previous candidate          |
| [[kbd:][C-h]]     | Display documentation (if available)     |
| [[kbd:][C-u]]     | Move to previous page of candidates      |
| [[kbd:][C-d]]     | Move to next page of candidates          |
| [[kbd:][C-s]]     | Filter candidates                        |
| [[kbd:][C-S-s]]   | Search candidates with helm/ivy          |
| [[kbd:][C-SPC]]   | Complete common                          |
| [[kbd:][TAB]]     | Complete common or select next candidate |
| [[kbd:][S-TAB]]   | Select previous candidate                |

** Vim-esque omni-completion prefix (C-x)
In the spirit of Vim's omni-completion, the following insert mode keybinds are
available to evil users to access specific company backends:
| Keybind | Description                       |
|---------+-----------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][C-x C-]]​] | Complete etags                    |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-f]] | Complete file path                |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-k]] | Complete from dictionary/keyword  |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-l]] | Complete full line                |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-o]] | Invoke complete-at-point function |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-n]] | Complete next symbol at point     |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-p]] | Complete previous symbol at point |
| [[kbd:][C-x C-s]] | Complete snippet                  |
| [[kbd:][C-x s]]   | Complete spelling suggestions     |

** Searching with multiple keywords
If the =vertico= module is enabled, users can perform code completion with multiple search keywords with an ampersand =&=.

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 🔨 /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[doom-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

** Enable company backend(s) in certain modes
The ~set-company-backend!~ function exists for setting ~company-backends~
buffer-locally in MODES, which is either a major-mode symbol, a minor-mode
symbol, or a list of either. BACKENDS are prepended to ~company-backends~ for
those modes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! js2-mode
  (set-company-backend! 'js2-mode 'company-tide 'company-yasnippet))

(after! sh-script
  (set-company-backend! 'sh-mode
    '(company-shell :with company-yasnippet)))

(after! cc-mode
  (set-company-backend! 'c-mode
    '(:separate company-irony-c-headers company-irony)))
#+end_src

To unset the backends for a particular mode, pass ~nil~ to it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! sh-script
  (set-company-backend! 'sh-mode nil))
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting
[[doom-report:][Report an issue?]]

** X-mode doesn't have code completion support or requires extra setup
There is no guarantee your language mode will have completion support.

Some, like ~lua-mode~, don't have completion support in Emacs at all. Others may
requires additional setup to get code completion working. For instance,
~go-mode~ requires ~guru~ to be installed on your system, and ~ruby-mode~
requires that you have a Robe server running (~M-x robe-start~).

Check the relevant module's documentation for this kind of information.

** No backends (or the incorrect ones) have been registered for X-mode
Doom expects every mode to have an explicit list of ~company-backends~ (and as
short a list as possible). This may mean you aren't getting all the completion
you want or any at all.

Check the value of ~company-backends~ ([[kbd:][SPC h v company-backends]]) from that mode
to see what backends are available. Check the [[*Assigning company backend(s) to modes][Configuration section]] for details
on changing what backends are available for that mode.
